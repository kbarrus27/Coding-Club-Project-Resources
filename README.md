# Coding Club Project Resources

Hi! If you're here, you're probably looking for music for your game! Here's how the process works:

1. Find a song you like on [this Google Drive folder.](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1yD7HGDlV0_pReHNlDnbiIQK-LeWdWcIo?usp=sharing)
2. Come back to this page (GitHub).
3. Click on the "music" folder.
4. Find the name of the song you want and click on it.
5. Near the top of the screen (in the same area that says "Code"  and "Blame"), you'll see a toolbar with a "Raw" button. Right-click on the "Raw" button and select "Copy link address" (the exact wording might vary depending on your browser).
6. Paste the copied link into your code.

And that's it!
